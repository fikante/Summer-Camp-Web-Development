    #8 COLOR 
        color of text, border, background
        # text color
            From CSS Version 3, there are five main ways to reference a color.

                By RGB value: RGB is a color model that adds the colors red (R), green (G) and blue (B) together to create colors. This is based on how the human eye sees colors.
                    p { 
                        color: rgb(255, 0, 0); 
                    }
                By RGBA value: RGBA is an extension of RGB that add an alpha (A) channel. The alpha channel represents the opacity, or transparency, of the color.
                    p { 
                        color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8); 
                    }
                By HSL value: HSL is a newer color model defined as Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Lightness (L). The aim of the model is to simplify mental visualization of the color that the value represents. 
                    Think of a rainbow that has been turned into a full circle. This represents the Hue. The Hue value is the degree value on this circle, from 0 degrees to 360 degrees. 0 is red, 120 is green and 240 is blue.
                    p { 
                        color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
                    }
                By hex value: Colors specified using hexadecimal are prefixed with a # symbol followed by the RGB value in hexadecimal format.
                    For example, the color red which is RGB 255,0,0 would be written as hexadecimal #FF0000.

                By predefined color names: Modern web browsers support 140 predefined color names. These color names are for convenience purposes and can be mapped to equivalent hex/RGB/HSL values.
                    black,silver,gray,white,maroon,red,purple,fuchsia,green,lime,olive,yellow,navy,blue,teal,aqua

    #9 PRIORITY ORDER
        The most specific definition gets the PRIORITY
        ! important gets precedence
        Inline styling gets precedence over class definitions 
            Ex: <div style="display: block; class="class-defn">
        If you use the same selector but different property values the the one which is written at the last
            note: but it cannot get the PRIORITY from the one which is written more specifically
                Ex: .myHeader h1{
                    font-size:30px;
                    }
                    h1{
                        font-size:40px;
                    }
                the first one gets the PRIORITY because it is written more specifically

    -Team Philosophies
        #Waterfall: launching all the result or product once all the application is completed
            #requirement
                -solid decisions
            #pros: to surprise the user side
            #cons: lead to backrupcy if the product fails
            #old system
        #Agile: launching minimum part of the product then add some on top of that rather than launching all at once
            #pros: to save money if the product fails
            #moder company systems

            #Way of managing your team if you follow agile team Philosophy
                #Let say there is 144 developers
                #Let say there are 500 pages to do on apple website
                #Let say the have to submit the final website after 6 months
                > Scrum
                    -set the maximum number of developers in one team
                        Ex: Amazon(two pizza rule)---12 worker in one team the there is 12 team for 144 total developers
                    -one director for the 12 teams 
                    -one team has one team lead(1) who is senior deverloper with total assumption of 30% senior(4), 50% mid-level developer(6) and 20% of juniour developer(2)
                    -The director divide the 500 pages eaqually to the 12 teams(41 for each) 
                > Scrum Master 
                    -Daily meeting
                    -Weekly progress report
                    -Sprint Review
                    -Launch
                > Sprints
                    -divide the total time given for the project by 15 days which is 12 sprints for the above case(how many times the webseite is launched until it is completed)
                    -what is launched is decided by the team leaders(the will decide what things are gonna be launched for the first 5 sprints)
                        Is it doable?
                        Ex:#Initial sprint
                            Home-page
